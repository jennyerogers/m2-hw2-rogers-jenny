        <h2>My Favorite Hobbies</h2>   
        <p>1. Exploring music: Music is one of my favorite pastimes. I love spending time on Spotify to delve into my music taste and discover new songs! I enjoy listening to The Black Keys, Arctic Monkeys, Johnny Cash and Jeff Buckley. 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygdVEIrVnIk&ab_channel=TheBlackKeys ">Check this video out!</a>
        </p>2. Working out: I have been lifting weights since I was 16 years old. It has become such a healthy outlet for me to keep my body moving.
        <p>3. Drawing: Ever since I was little, I have loved art. When I make art, I feel like I am in my own bubble of creativity and expression. Though I am not an art major, I hope to explore my artistic side more through my degree in web design.</p>
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>Many of my interests already align with my hobbies, but here are a few more that I would like to share with you!
            <p>Outside of my aforementioned hobbies, I love to spend time outdoors. Whether it's hiking, traveling or just going to the park, getting some sunshine in always puts me in a good mood. Also, I love watching movies! Over the past year, I started an account on Letterboxd, a film app, that allows me to rate, review and log new movies I watch. It's super fun!</p>
        <h2>Career Goals</h2>
        <p>I have a couple of options for a possible career path that I have considered. Throughout most of my time in college, I have wanted to become a news reporter. I fell in love with news after my first reporting class, which involved me writing weekly stories on the Gainesville community. However, reporters have tough, taxing jobs. I have also considered becoming a web developer or graphic designer after I earn my master's degree in web design from the University of Florida. I feel like this is the option I'm leaning towards because it allows for more flexibility in my work schedule, higher pay and I'm able to express my artistic vision!</p>
